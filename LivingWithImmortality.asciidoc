== Prologue

This is the bit I'm really bad at.

I was there, I saw it happen, and with enough wine in me, I can tell the story well enough. Enough to make you laugh at our folly, with enough wine in you. Sober, I can whisper the same story to heavy-lidded children fighting against sleep, and mostly they will dream of courage and treasure. Mostly.

So yes, back home I'm a teller of tales... for people I've known their entire lives, and who've heard my tales at least as long. If I get a little lost, they all know how these stories go, and are not slow to remind me.

You, however... Children of children of strangers, posterity, how shall I address you?
