Write Your Own Adventure - my experiments with Atom, ASCIIdoc, Markdown, etc...

First line written in Atom! <= Yay!

Monday, August 31st 2020: I am starting a daily writing practice, and since Atom + GitHub is my go-to writing environment, this is the logical place to track it.

I'm not sure what form(s) the writing will take, setting notes, short fiction, etc... and I'm also not sure how it will be structured or organized here. I'm not going to let that stop me, however, and I'll figure that out later.
